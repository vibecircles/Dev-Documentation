# Routes

Routes define the API endpoints and map them to controller functions. They handle HTTP method routing and can include middleware for authentication and validation.

## 1. Auth Routes (`Routes/AuthRoute.js`)

**Base Path:** `/auth`

| Method | Endpoint | Controller | Description |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| POST | `/register` | `registerUser` | Register new user |
| POST | `/login` | `loginUser` | User login |

### Route Details

- **No authentication required** for these routes
- Both routes accept JSON request bodies
- Both routes return user object and JWT token on success
